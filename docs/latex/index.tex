The {\bfseries{NSB Solver}} project is a high-\/performance C++ library dedicated to fluid simulation, particularly the solution of the {\bfseries{Navier-\/\+Stokes-\/\+Brinkman Equations}}.

It is developed as part of the HPSC for Aerospace Engineering course and aims to provide an efficient and parallelizable solution for three-\/dimensional grid fluid dynamics problem.
